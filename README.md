MDT-DashboardR-POC
==================

MDT Dashboard using SignalR (Proof of Concept project)

What is this project about?
----------

I saw Mikael's great MDT status webpage generation script and I thought, as much as like knowing how my deployments are going; it'd be great if I can do it at the pub, on my mobile, using a web page!

I had some previous code I used to create a basic SignalR application so this project is about creating a proof-of-concept application for monitoring MDT deployments using a web page for presentation and SignalR as the transport.

So this project is inspired by Mikael Nystrom, Brady Gaster and Beer!
